Although she says that he had been an excellent student in high school, his grades have begun slipping in his second year in college, and he no longer socializes with friends. When she asked him why he no longer talks to his friends, she states that he told her, “They already know where I am. They can see me. They watch me from my bedroom window, so they already know what I’m doing. We don’t need to talk.” She found this to be bizarre, as nearly all of his friends live hours away. The patient states that he feels fine and doesn’t understand why everyone thinks he is crazy.

{"question": "A 24-year-old woman presents with her husband to a physician with the complaints of fever, cough, and cold for the past 5 days. When the physician asks her if she has taken any medication for her symptoms, she answers, “My husband and I possess great powers to heal sickness. So I tried to cure my symptoms with my power. However, due to some divine cause, it did not work this time, so I thought I should seek medical advice”. Upon asking her husband about this, he says, \"I have always had an immense ability to heal others through my powerful thoughts. It is only after I married her that she came to realize the powers within herself.” The physician examines her and prescribes appropriate medications for her symptoms. A year later, the woman presents again to the same physician with a cough and cold for 2 days. The physician asks her why did she not use her ‘power’ this time.

{"question": "A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her friends. She is naked except for a blanket and speaking rapidly and incoherently.
