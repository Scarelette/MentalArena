Jeannerod et al. from Lyon used attribution judgements that suggested that the sense of agency would not depend uniquely on the motor mechanisms but would also involve conscious processes. Recently, Frith et al. have published new data that integrates both preceding models. According to this theory, the sense of agency would depend on the processes involved in the predictive control of action but at a conscious level: the attenuation of the sensory feedback, specific of our own actions. This attenuation would depend on the accuracy of comparison between the predicted state and the actual state. Moreover, the sense of agency would also imply the management of social frame, which normally gives the means to cope with human interaction."], "LABELS": ["BACKGROUND", "RESULTS"], "LONG_ANSWER": "The conception of the sense of agency has greatly evolved over the years, mainly because of the various experimental methods employed. The consequences of this are the various theoretical interpretations given to the characteristics of the sense of agency. They can be explained in two main points: a non-unified definition of the sense of agency and an absence of experimental data testing alternative interpretations. First, protocols using attribution judgements have proven to be useful to gain better understanding of the attribution mechanism in schizophrenia. However, findings obtained with these judgments have often been used to conclude on deficits of the sense of agency in schizophrenia, whereas the sense of agency is only a sub component of these judgements.", "MESHES": [], "final_decision": "no", "id": "18033150"}

We demonstrate that secreted reelin binds to receptors of the lipoprotein family on neurons with a punctate reelin IR. Secondly, using calcium imaging techniques, we examined the physiological consequences of reelin secretion blockade. Blocking protein secretion rapidly and reversibly changes the subunit composition of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to a predominance of NR2B-containing NMDARs. Addition of recombinant or endogenously secreted reelin rescues the effects of protein secretion blockade and reverts the fraction of NR2B-containing NMDARs to control levels.

We previously reported that speeded prosaccade responses, i.e., shorter response latencies for automatic shifts of attention to visual targets, were associated with higher antisaccade error rates in schizophrenia. This suggests that dysregulation of automatic attentional processes may contribute to disturbances in prefrontally mediated control of voluntary behavior.", "Twenty-four antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia patients and 30 healthy individuals completed three tasks: a no-gap prosaccade task in which subjects shifted gaze toward a peripheral target that appeared coincident with the disappearance of a central fixation target and separate prosaccade and antisaccade tasks in which a temporal gap or overlap of the central target offset and peripheral target onset occurred. Sixteen patients were retested after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment.", "Patients' prosaccade latencies in the no-gap task were speeded compared with healthy individuals. While patients were not atypical in the degree to which response latencies were speeded or slowed by the gap and overlap manipulations, those patients with diminished attentional engagement on the prosaccade task (i.e., reduced overlap effect) had significantly elevated antisaccade error rates.

{"QUESTION": "Does cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor itraconazole affect plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in schizophrenic patients?", "CONTEXTS": ["Despite the belief that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 alone is responsible for the metabolism of risperidone, several studies suggest that CYP3A may be involved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of itraconazole, a CYP3A inhibitor, on the plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone in schizophrenic patients in relation to CYP2D6 genotype.", "Nineteen schizophrenic patients treated with 2 to 8 mg/d of risperidone received 200 mg/d of itraconazole for a week. Plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured immediately before and after itraconazole treatment, as well as at 1 week after itraconazole treatment was stopped, together with clinical assessment by use of the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser Side Effect Rating Scale and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.", "Dose-normalized plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone before itraconazole treatment (0.9 +/- 0.8 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 6.9 +/- 3.3 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1), respectively) were significantly elevated after itraconazole treatment (1.6 +/- 1.3 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 11.3 +/- 4.5 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1)) and decreased 1 week after its discontinuation (1.0 +/- 0.8 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1) and 7.2 +/- 3.7 ng.mL(-1).mg(-1)) (P < .01). However, the ratio of risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone, an index of CYP2D6 activity, did not differ before itraconazole treatment (0.14 +/- 0.13), after itraconazole treatment (0.15 +/- 0.13), and 1 week after discontinuation (0.14 +/- 0.13) (P > .05). Itraconazole increased the concentrations of risperidone by 69% (P < .001) and 75% (P < .01) in CYP2D6 extensive and poor metabolizers, respectively. In addition, the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) also increased similarly, by 71% (P < .001) and 73% (P < .05), respectively, with itraconazole, without a significant difference between CYP2D6 genotypes.

{"QUESTION": "Does dopamine D2 receptor occupancy predict catalepsy and the suppression of conditioned avoidance response behavior in rats?", "CONTEXTS": ["Human positron emission tomography (PET) shows that striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy predicts extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Patients showed a clinical response with > or = 65% D2 occupancy, but EPS only when D2 occupancy >78%. Catalepsy and the selective suppression of conditioned avoidance response (CAR) are often used as animal models to predict EPS and antipsychotic effect, respectively. However, the quantitative relationship between striatal D2 occupancy and effects in these models is not known.", "The present study intended to investigate the relationship between animal catalepsy, suppression of CAR, and D2 receptor blockade using a method of evaluating D2 receptor occupancy similar in principle to that used in patients.", "In vivo binding of [11C]-raclopride and [3H]-raclopride was compared.

Effects of raclopride on conditioned avoidance response (CAR) behavior were tested.", "In vivo binding of [11C]-raclopride compared to [3H]-raclopride was virtually the same. Using [3H]-raclopride, cold raclopride (0.01-0.2 mg/kg) produced 16-77% D2 receptor occupancy and no catalepsy. Raclopride (0.5-2 mg/kg) produced 83-95% D2 occupancy and significant catalepsy. Raclopride (2 mg/kg) produced on average 95% and 87% D2 receptor occupancy 1 and 2 h after administration, respectively, and maximum catalepsy. D2 occupancy at 4, 8 and 24 h was on average 58%, 46%, and 4%, respectively. No catalepsy was observed.

Suppression of CAR occurred at a D2 occupancy of around 70-75%, and catalepsy at D2 occupancy >80%. Results closely resembled human studies where 65-70% D2 occupancy was required for antipsychotic response, while > or = 80% D2 occupancy led to EPS.
